            The computer is one of the most known items in our world. There is a computer in everything, for example all of our phones and watches and televisions. All of those items have computers in them. they come in many shapes and sizes but they all originate from one computer ,ENIAC.  <p>

                    <p> ENIAC is one of the most important computers in history. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator) was the first general-purpose computer. ENIAC weighed about 30 tons and covered around 1,800 square feet. it original purpose was to be used in WWII to calculate firing tables for target accuracy. it was use for about 10 years from 1946-1955. Saldy it was shutdown on october 2nd at 11:45 pm. that ended the life of the ENIAC. you would think that if the end and you cant see it anymore, but no the ENIAC is in penn university, at The Moore School of Electrical Engineering. And you can also visit it right now for free.

                <p> Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines to think like humans, or doing human required tasks. A question that people had when computers were first made was “can computers think?” During the 1950s the answer was no. but due to recent technology the answer is yes. We have created robots to clean our houses and play sports and drive our cars for us. People like Elon Musk are working hard to make smarter and better robots which will improve our future. </p>
