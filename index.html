                    <p> ENIAC is one of the most important computers in history. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator) was the first general-purpose computer. ENIAC weighed about 30 tons and covered around 1,800 square feet. it original purpose was to be used in WWII to calculate firing tables for target accuracy. you would think that it is in a museum but you are wrong. the ENIAC is in penn university, at The Moore School of Electrical Engineering. And you can also visit it right now for free.
