                    <p> ENIAC is one of the most important computers in history. ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator) was the first general-purpose computer. ENIAC weighed about 30 tons and covered around 1,800 square feet. it original purpose was to be used in WWII to calculate firing tables for target accuracy. it was use for about 10 years from 1946-1955. Saldy it was shutdown on october 2nd at 11:45 pm. that ended the life of the ENIAC. you would think that if the end and you cant see it anymore, but no the ENIAC is in penn university, at The Moore School of Electrical Engineering. And you can also visit it right now for free.
